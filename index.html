    <p>My name is Tohru Adachi. I'm 27 years old. My house is located somewhere within Inaba, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Inaba Police department, and I get home every day
      by 1 am at the earliest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 3am and make sure I get 2 hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty 
      minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues
      at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a less boring life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to
      lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone. As I love cabbages, and own a gun.</p>
